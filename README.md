## 📚 Learnings & Reflections

### 🔥 Biggest Lesson: Never Skip Planning

> “A lack of planning is planning to fail.”

- UI should be **planned first**.
- Structure your code **based on the planned UI**.
- **Stick to the plan**. Even a small change in features or layout later can break large parts of your code.

### 🧪 Importance of a Test Route

- Always create a **test route** to verify backend deployment.

### 🔐 Environment Variables Mastery

- `.env` allows seamless switching between dev and prod:
  - Local dev → uses `.env` file.
  - Production → uses Render/Vercel environment variables.
- **No manual changes** before pushing code – code behaves based on environment.
- Result: **Carefree development** with no mistakes.

## 🛠️ Features to Improve

### 🏠 7. Fix Home Button Behavior

### 👤 8. Logout implementation

## 🚧 Bugs & Improvements

### ✍️ 1. Blog Post Page Issues

- ❌ If a field is left empty while posting, the form **freezes with spinner**.
- 🛑 **Form becomes read-only** after pressing "Post" — not ideal.
- 🧩 Fields should be disabled only **during** submission, then **restored**.

### 🔁 2. Redux Use is Pointless Without Persistence

- State doesn't persist after page reloads or navigation.
- Consider adding **Redux Persist** or localStorage/sessionStorage.

### 🗂️ 3. AI Sentiment Analysis ✅ (Done 🎉)
