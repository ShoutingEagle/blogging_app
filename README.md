- Learnings

    - Biggest mistake / learing
        Not Planning the project
            UI needs to planned first 
            Then the code structure
            And always stick to the plan no matter what, because a small change in UI or feature may cause you to change your entire code (portion of your project)

    - Make a test route, which will be used to check after deploying the backend


    - Understood the value of .env variables
        - It lets you switch dynamically between production and development with changing the variable values
        - for development the files take the values from local .env file
        - in production the values are taken from environment variables 
        - care free coding, no hassle and pushing code to repo without hassling of changing variable values
          every time.

Because even after pressing the post button options can be altered

2. Redux is useless unless the state persists throughout the pages even after navigating


4. Need to make category feature

5. Implement search Feature



3. AI Sentiment to implement âœ…
